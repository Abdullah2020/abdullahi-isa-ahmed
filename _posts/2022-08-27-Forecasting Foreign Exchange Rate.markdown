description:  This is my 'Hamoye AI Lab' Data Science summer internship collaborated premiere project. This project focuses on Time Series analyses. The dataset used for this project was downloaded on Kaggle. The dataset contains some currencies with their rates in dollar units.</p><p> The project used three models (Linear Regression, ARIMA and FBprophet Algorithms) and these modelsâ€™ performances were evaluated using different time series forecasting performance measures by testing how well these models have predicted with respect to the actual observations. The project also compared and determined which one of these models will be able to make a better forecast comparing the results from the performance evaluation methods. In conlusion, the 3 models we built, ARIMA Model gave us the best results with the lowest Evaluation Matric of MAE,MSE,RMSE and MAPE respectively. This was used to forecast the Exchange rate for the last 30 days.</p><b>Kindly find the project notebook to the project here!</b><a href="https://github.com/Abdullah2020/Hamoye-2022-Selenium-Group/blob/Abu_umar/Selenium%20Premier%20Project/Hamoye_Premier_Project_Selenium.ipynb/" target="_blank"</i> Link.
