description: Over the years, life expectancy has increased with accelerated aging of the population, which has called for increased attention. Elder care and medical issues are becoming a major social issue in the world.<p>Thus, this project implemented a full-fledged IoT connected system that aimed as collecting information from the sensors layer and send it through gateway (raspberry pi). The platform allow the hospital users to check their vital signs (e.g pulse, temperature) and other ambient values such as temperature and humidity. Some functionalities may raise alerts (sensors threshold exceeded for instance) at the visualisation level.</p><b>This is my Github repository to the project source codes:</b><a href="https://github.com/Abdullah2020/Development-of-Smart-Healthcare-Solution.git/" target="_blank"</i> Link.
