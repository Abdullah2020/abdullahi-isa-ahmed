description: The aim of this project was to develop a machine learning model that can predict injuries based on the training regimen of an athlete. It can be used to make injury prevention approaches easier to develop. This project focuses on Machine Learning Classification analyses, and it uses two (2) separate datasets, namely, the weekly & daily. The dataset was downloaded via Kaggle platform. </p><p> The project prediction was based on three (3) models on the weekly approach dataset namely, the DNN, K-NN, and XGBoost algorithm while on the daily approach, the project also implemented four models, namely, DNN, K-NN and XGBoost. Thus, the best-performing model on the daily dataset was K-NN with an accuracy of 97%. The weekly dataset on the other hand, k-NN was the best model with about 97% accuracy (f1-score). Furthermore, the feature with the highest influence on injury status was the ‘sum of max km’ with about 4.7 to 34.5km per day according to explorations on the data.</p><b>Attached here is the project GitHub repository!</b><a href="https://github.com/Abdullah2020/Hamoye-2022-Capstone-Project_Neural_Network_Group/" target="_blank"</i> Link.
